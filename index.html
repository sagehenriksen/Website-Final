      <p>
Sage Henriksen is a singer-songwriter, guitarist, composer, and producer soon to graduate from CalArts’ Performer-Composer program with a specialization in Film Scoring. Coming from a background in opera and musical theater, with a flare for the dramatic, their work focuses on overcoming literal and personal apocalypses. Playing with both acoustic and highly synthesized sounds, Sage’s music ranges the gambit from classical to contemporary, and rock to folk. As an artist, Sage’s work is highly influenced by their experience as a queer and disabled musician. They’re currently performing in multipul friend’s bands and the duo The Serious Musicians. Sage works in Ableton, Logic, and Pro Tools with a passion for recording and live sound. They are currently working towards becoming a touring/recording musician, scoring music for film, television and animation, producing, engineering, and writing their first rock opera.
